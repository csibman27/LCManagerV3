# Explain your versioning system 

Explain semantic versioning to your users and teach them how to read and understand your version numbers. Explaining your system is especially important when you sell B2C, when you can assume your clientele doesn't understand semantic versioning, but it also applies in B2B selling.
For example, software version 1.3.1 means that the software is in its first major version, with three additional functionalities added, and one patch fix implemented. When a developer fixes a bug in that version, the next version release is named version 1.3.2.
